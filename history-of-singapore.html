                The history of the modern state of Singapore dates back to its founding in the early 19th century; however, evidence suggests that a significant
                 trading settlement existed on the island in the 14th century. The last ruler of the Kingdom of Singapura, Parameswara, was expelled by the Majapahit or 
                 the Siamese before he founded Malacca. Singapore then came under the Malacca Sultanate and subsequently the Johor Sultanate. In 1819, British statesman
                  Stamford Raffles negotiated a treaty whereby Johor would allow the British to locate a trading port on the island, ultimately leading to the establishment
                   of the Crown colony of Singapore in 1867. Important reasons for the rise of Singapore were its nodal position at the tip of the Malay Peninsula flanked 
                   by the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the presence of a natural sheltered harbour, as well as its status as a free port.
                
                During World War II, Singapore was invaded and occupied by the Japanese Empire from 1942 to 1945. When the Japanese surrendered, Singapore reverted 
                to British control, with increasing levels of self-government being granted, resulting in Singapore's merger with the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia
                 in 1963. However, social unrest, racial tensions, and political differences between Singapore's governing People's Action Party (PAP) and Malaysia's Alliance 
                 Party resulted in Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia. Singapore became an independent republic on 9 August 1965.
                
                By the 1990s, the country had become one of the world's most prosperous nations, with a highly developed free market economy and strong international 
                trading links. It now has the highest per capita gross domestic product in Asia, which is 7th in the world, and it is ranked 9th on the UN Human Development 
                Index.</p>
